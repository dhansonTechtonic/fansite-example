                <p>Trench continues the band's exploration of themes surrounding insecurity, faith, suicide, and mental health, prominent
                themes on Twenty One Pilots' previous albums. The album was formed around the conceptual world of "Trench", created
                by Joseph and represented through the album's accompanying marketing and music videos. Much of the album and its marketing material discusses the city of "Dema". Dema, literally meaning "Tower of Silence",
                is a fictional location set inside of Trench that draws its name from Zoroastrianism. In that religion, Towers of
                Silence were used to dispose of dead bodies by having vultures eat the corpses. The band explained on Reddit that they
                were inspired by the "sad and intriguing concept of a dying religion... the reason it was dying was something they could
                never control: The lack of the vultures needed to carry out their theology. Something so natural and logical can get in
                the way of your religion." Trench's city, Dema, is ruled by nine "bishops", whose names are Nico (full name Nicolas Bourbaki, based on a collective
                pseudonym of a group of mainly French mathematicians), Andre, Lisden, Keons, Reisdro, Sacarver, Nills, Vetomo, and
                Listo. The chief bishop, Nico, was revealed by Joseph to be Blurryface, the personification of his insecurities from
                their previous album of the same name. Other characters involved are part of a group who call themselves the
                "Banditos", whose aim is to liberate the people of Dema. They adopt the color yellow, specifically 0xFCE300, which the
                bishops are unable to see.</p>

                    The album, like Twenty One Pilots' previous records, contains many different genres of music, including alternative
                    rock, alternative hip hop, pop rock,electronic rock, R&B, reggae, hip hop,
                    electropop, rap rock, and pop. It opens with alternative and hard rock song "Jumpsuit", dealing with Tyler
                    Joseph's insecurities. It was described by Rolling Stone as having "distorted bass guitar, crisp drumming and
                    dark washes of synth" with Joseph's vocals building from "a near-whisper to a full-throated scream, to an atmospheric
                    falsetto." The song's outro merges into the next track, "Levitate", a minimalist rap track. "Morph" explores the
                    themes of life after death and references the leading bishop, Nico. The song has been compared to artists such as
                    Khalid, The Prodigy and DJ Shadow.The following track, "My Blood", is an indie pop song about remaining loyal
                    to a friend. The track has been compared to songs such as Foster the People's "Pumped Up Kicks" and Portugal. The
                    Man's "Feel It Still" due to the song's chorus featuring a falsetto sung by Joseph. "Chlorine" is a song about
                    cleansing your mind from dark thoughts. "Smithereens" is a "cute and playful" song about Joseph's love for his wife,
                    Jenna, whom he married in 2015.

                    <p>Blurryface is the fourth studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, released on May 17, 2015, through
                    Fueled by Ramen.
                    
                    Like their previous album Vessel (2013), the album takes influence from various genres, including hip hop, rock, pop,
                    reggae, and indie. Lyrically, the album incorporates themes of mental health, doubt, and religion. It contains the
                    successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride", which both reached the top-five on the Billboard Hot 100. Blurryface was well-received by critics, who complimented its themes and musical diversity. It is considered to be the
                    band's breakthrough album, becoming their first to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album has sold over 1.5
                    million copies in the United States as of April 2017.[9] In 2018, Blurryface became the first album in the digital era
                    to have every track receive at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[10][11] On
                    May 15, 2019, it reached the milestone of being on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart for four years, never leaving the
                    chart.</p>

The album is named after a character the band created called Blurryface. According to Joseph, he "represents all the
things that I as an individual, but also everyone around, are insecure about." Joseph wears black paint on his hands
and neck during his live shows and music videos for the album, to represent Blurryface, saying: "Very dramatic, I know,
but it helps me get into that character."

Art direction and design was done by Brandon Rike, Reel Bear Media and Virgilio Tzaj.[15] Rob Gold was the art manager,
while Josh Skubel was in charge of packaging production.[15] Jabari Jacobs provided photography. Rike mentions on
his blog about the different feel of the artwork from Vessel and how the red on Blurryface is "the color of passion,
violence, and anger", although the band is famous for their content being open to interpretation.

                            <p>Vessel is the third studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots, which was released on January 8, 2013. It is
                            the band's first album released via Fueled by Ramen, and is their major-label debut album. As of July 2016, the album
                            has sold over 569,000 copies. All of its tracks have been certified at least Gold by the RIAA, making Twenty One
                            Pilots the first group or artist to achieve this feat with the two separate albums. High-school colleagues Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas, and Chris Salih formed Twenty One Pilots in 2009. The group
                            released their debut album Twenty One Pilots. Both Thomas and Salih parted ways with the band in 2011. Soon
                            afterwards, Josh Dun joined the band; Joseph had been friends with Dun for around a year. Joseph first saw Dun
                            when he was playing a show with House of Heroes. Joseph said that he "loved" the performance. The band
                            released Regional at Best later that year. In June, the duo played their first out-of-state show to a group of 12
                            people. The pair soon gained popularity through a series of videos made by friend Mark C. Eshleman. The band
                            played their last show as an unsigned band at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio, to a crowd of 1,800 in
                            attendance. The duo signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2012.</p>

                                The songs "Ode to Sleep", "Holding on to You", "Car Radio", "Guns for Hands", and "Trees" were taken from the previous
                                album, Regional at Best. Joseph composed the album "not knowing whether or not people were going to hear it".
                                
                                Recording for Vessel took place at Rocket Carousel Studio, located in Los Angeles, California with Greg Wells
                                producing. Wells provided additional synths, keyboards and programming. Wells mixed the album, while Ian
                                McGregor helped with recording. Mastering was performed by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg
                                Mastering, also in Los Angeles.
                                
                                The album cover features the duo's paternal grandfathers. The man on the left was Dun's grandfather Earl Owen Dun, who
                                died shortly after the album's release, and the man on the right is Joseph's grandfather Robert O. "Bobby" Joseph,
                                who died on March 17, 2018.
